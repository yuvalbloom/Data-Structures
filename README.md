# Data-Structures
Various Data Structures from my CS studies - in Python and Java

The Java based data structures for the AVL Tree and Hash Tables using probing methods were coded in collaboration with a fellow student, Inbar Havilio.

The AVL Tree was executed to compare between a Cicrular List and a Tree List, a list created using the AVL data structure.
The Hash Tables were executed using different types of probing methods, such as Linear probing, Double Hash probing and more.
